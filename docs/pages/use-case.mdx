# Intro Use Case

## The Problem

A bank receives large volumes of customer and vendor documents every day:

- payslips for loan assessment
- invoices for operations and finance checks
- mixed quality text content from email and portals (scanned/image files require OCR before intake)

If people do all extraction manually, it is slow, expensive, and inconsistent.
If AI does everything without guardrails, bad data can slip into decisions.

## What This Project Solves

This project gives you a controlled AI intake pipeline:

1. AI extracts structured fields from raw document text.
2. System validation checks business rules and confidence.
3. Only uncertain cases go to human review.
4. Every step is auditable for compliance and incident review.

So the bank gets speed from AI, but keeps risk controls and traceability.

## A Simple Story

1. A customer uploads a payslip.
2. API stores the file in MinIO object storage (bucket `documents`).
3. MinIO emits an object-created event, and `event-handler` starts the Temporal workflow.
4. Workflow stores file metadata, detects document type, and runs LLM Phase A extraction.
5. If JSON is broken, Phase B repairs the output.
6. If values look wrong by rules, Phase C tries correction.
7. If still low confidence, case goes to reviewer queue.
8. Reviewer approves, rejects, or corrects through API.
9. Final result is saved with full audit trail.

## Where This Is Useful

- loan origination and servicing
- mortgage and personal lending ops
- accounts payable document intake
- shared services teams that process invoices and proof of income

## What You Get

- faster document processing
- fewer manual touches on clean cases
- safer handling of uncertain cases
- clear evidence of what AI produced and what humans approved
